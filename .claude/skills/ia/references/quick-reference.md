# iA Quick Reference — Tool Selection

> **Rule Zero:** Never search the local workspace/filesystem for IBM i members or source — always resolve through `ia_*` tools. See [SKILL.md → Routing Pitfalls](../SKILL.md) for the common wrong-tool traps (F-specs, BIF search, join LFs, lifecycle).
>
> **Rule One:** UPPERCASE every object/member/file/field name before calling a tool (`iAdepRpt` → `IADEPRPT`). Names are stored uppercase; the tools also upper-case in SQL, but normalize on your side too.
>
> **Rule Two:** Empty result = not found. Report the negative; never substitute a similarly-named file and present its results instead.
