# iA Tools for IBM i — Impact Analysis MCP Tool Definitions

SQL-based [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) tool definitions for **Impact Analysis (iA)** on IBM i. These tools query pre-parsed IBM i source metadata in the iA repository (built by [programmers.io](https://www.programmers.io/)) to provide cross-reference lookups, call hierarchy analysis, field impact analysis, and more.

Use them with **VS Code GitHub Copilot**, **Claude Code**, or any MCP-compatible AI agent to ask natural-language questions about your IBM i codebase.

### `/ia` Skill (for Claude Code)

## Tools (51 custom + 2 built-in)

## Quick Start — VS Code + GitHub Copilot

This is the recommended way to use and develop iA tools. VS Code will automatically start the MCP server when you open this folder.

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **VS Code** | With [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) extension installed (Copilot Chat required) |
| **Node.js 18+** | Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) — required to run the MCP server |
| **IBM i access** | Db2 for i accessible via [Mapepire](https://mapepire.github.io/) on port 8076 |
| **iA repository** | Your IBM i source must be parsed by [programmers.io iA](https://www.programmers.io/) into a library (e.g., `SDK01`) |

### Step 1: Fork and clone

```bash
# Fork this repo on GitHub (click the "Fork" button), then:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ia-tools-ibmi.git
cd ia-tools-ibmi
```

### Step 2: Configure your IBM i connection

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your IBM i credentials:

```
DB2i_HOST=your-ibmi-hostname
DB2i_USER=your-user-profile
DB2i_PASS=your-password
DB2i_PORT=8076
IA_LIBRARY=SDK01
```

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DB2i_HOST` | IBM i hostname or IP address |
| `DB2i_USER` | IBM i user profile with `*READ` authority to iA tables |
| `DB2i_PASS` | Password for the user profile |
| `DB2i_PORT` | Mapepire port (default: `8076`) |
| `IA_LIBRARY` | Library where iA repository tables are stored (default: `SDK01`) |
| `IBMI_ENABLE_EXECUTE_SQL` | Set to `true` to enable the built-in `execute_sql` tool (default: `false`) |

> **Security**: `.env` is in `.gitignore` — your credentials are never committed.

### Step 3: Start the MCP server

Install and start the MCP server in a terminal:

```bash
npm install -g @ibm/ibmi-mcp-server
npx @ibm/ibmi-mcp-server --transport http --tools ./impact-analysis.yaml
```

You should see output like:
```
IBM i MCP Server listening on http://localhost:3010
```

> **Keep this terminal running** — the MCP server must stay active while you use VS Code.

> **Windows users**: If `npx` gives "Access is denied", use `node` directly:
> ```bash
> node %APPDATA%\npm\node_modules\@ibm\ibmi-mcp-server\dist\index.js --transport http --tools ./impact-analysis.yaml
> ```

### Step 4: Open in VS Code

```bash
code .
```

VS Code detects `.vscode/mcp.json` and connects to the running MCP server at `http://localhost:3010/mcp`. The 51 iA tools plus built-in SQL tools become available in Copilot Chat.

### Step 5: Use iA tools in Copilot Chat

1. **Open Copilot Chat**: Press `Ctrl+Alt+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+I` (Mac)
2. **Switch to Agent mode**: Click the mode dropdown at the top of the chat panel and select **"Agent"**
3. **Verify tools are loaded**: Click the **tools icon** (wrench/hammer) at the top-left of the chat input — you should see the 51 `ia-*` tools plus `execute_sql` and `describe_sql_object` listed under "ibmi-ia-tools"
4. **Ask a question** — the agent will automatically pick the right iA tool:

```
Find all programs that reference CUSTFILE
```
```
Show the call hierarchy for ORDERPGM
```
```
What is the blast radius of changing field CUSTNO in ORDERFILE?
```
```
List all variables in program ORDHIST
```

> **Note**: Copilot will ask for your confirmation before running each MCP tool. Click **"Allow"** (or "Always allow" for this session).

## Alternative Setup

### Claude Code

Create a `.mcp.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ibmi-ia-tools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@ibm/ibmi-mcp-server@latest", "--tools", "/full/path/to/impact-analysis.yaml"],
      "cwd": "."
    }
  }
}
```

Set `DB2i_HOST`, `DB2i_USER`, `DB2i_PASS`, `DB2i_PORT`, and `IA_LIBRARY` as environment variables (or in `.env` in the same directory — the MCP server loads it automatically).

### Other Platforms (Cursor, Continue.dev, Windsurf, Cline, Aider)

See **[PLATFORM-SETUP.md](PLATFORM-SETUP.md)** for MCP connection snippets.

### Command Line (manual testing)

Run the MCP server directly to test without an AI agent:

```bash
# Install the MCP server globally
npm install -g @ibm/ibmi-mcp-server

# Set environment variables
export DB2i_HOST=your-ibmi-host
export DB2i_USER=your-user
export DB2i_PASS=your-password
export DB2i_PORT=8076
export IA_LIBRARY=SDK01

# Start in HTTP mode for manual testing
npx @ibm/ibmi-mcp-server --transport http --tools ./impact-analysis.yaml
# Server starts at http://localhost:3010
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `npx: Access is denied` (Windows) | Install globally: `npm install -g @ibm/ibmi-mcp-server`, then use `node %APPDATA%\npm\node_modules\@ibm\ibmi-mcp-server\dist\index.js --transport http --tools ./impact-analysis.yaml` |
| MCP server not starting | Check Node.js version: `node --version` (must be 18+) |
| Tools not showing in Copilot Chat | Make sure you're in **Agent** mode (not Ask or Edit mode). Click the tools icon to enable/disable specific tools |
| Tools not connecting in VS Code | Ensure the MCP server is running in a separate terminal (`http://localhost:3010`) before opening VS Code |
| `Connection refused` on port 8076 | Verify Mapepire is running on your IBM i — check with your system administrator |
| Tools return no data | Check `IA_LIBRARY` in `.env` matches your iA library name. Verify the user profile has `*READ` authority to the iA tables |
| YAML syntax error | Validate the file: `npx js-yaml impact-analysis.yaml` |
| MCP server shows stale tools after edit | Stop (`Ctrl+C`) and restart the MCP server in your terminal |
